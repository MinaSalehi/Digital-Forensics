 This lab introduces incident response by simulating a real-world scenario, where students conduct analysis as an investigator. Through hands-on exercises, students will apply fundamental forensic techniques to assess system activity and identify potential threats. By engaging in this simulation, participants will develop essential skills for recognizing, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.
